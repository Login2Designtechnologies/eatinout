  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy Black
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Black.otf
    - family: Gilroy Light
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Light.otf
    - family: Gilroy Heavy
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Heavy.otf
    - family: Gilroy Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Medium.otf
    - family: Gilroy Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Bold.otf
    - family: Gilroy ExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-ExtraBold.otf
    - family: Gilroy Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Regular.otf
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
